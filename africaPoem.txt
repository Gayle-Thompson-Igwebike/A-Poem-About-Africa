Africa...
My Africa....Mine.
How majestic art thou.
How green are thine bossoms...
Embracing me, Welcoming me, Shielding me...
From fears, hunger and pain.
Sheilding me...From worries and traumas and stress.
In thine arms alone do I find solace...
In thy bossoms alone do mine head rest.
For you are mine...My Africa...
Find me and bring me home...mama.
