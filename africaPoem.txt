Africa...
My Africa....Mine.
How majestic art thou.
How green are thine bossoms...
Embracing me, Welcoming me, Shielding me...
From fears, hunger and pain.
Sheilding me...From worries and traumas and stress.
I love you mama earth...
In thine arms alone do I find solace...
In thy bossoms alone do mine head rest.
For you are mine...My Africa...
Mine.
Find me and bring me home...mama.
