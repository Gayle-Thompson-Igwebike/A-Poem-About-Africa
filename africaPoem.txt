Africa...      // This is my "\BRANCE"\ of the AFRICA POEM that I created off the main... GIT LESSONS
My Africa....Mine.
How majestic art thou.
How green are thine bossoms...
Embracing me, Welcoming me, Shielding me...
From fears, hunger and pain.
Sheilding me...From worries and traumas and stress.

// BRANCH CREATED TITLED EUROPE....

In thine arms alone do I find solace...
In thy bossoms alone do mine head rest.
For you are mine...My Africa...
Find me and bring me home...mama.


THE MAIN VERSION WILL NOT HAVE THIS UPDATE MADE ON THIS BRANCH...//
